# Authoring

load-when: writing or editing the text inside a skill, and committing it

## Rules

- Write and edit every skill with `/writing-for-agents`. Read its `SKILL-MECHANICS.md`
  for frontmatter and the model-invoked versus user-invoked choice.
- Commit types are `feat`, `fix`, and the rest of the conventional set. Not `docs`.
- The commit scope is the skill name: `feat(clean-code): ...`.
- A forked skill records its source and what changed in `README.md`, under **Forked
  skills**. Nothing about the fork's origin goes inside the skill itself.
- A skill folder holds steps, templates and the reference a run needs. Documentation
  *about* a method — its reasoning, its decisions, its history — goes in `docs/`.
- `docs/` is one flat folder of plain markdown. Reach for VitePress once it passes
  roughly five files, or once a section needs a public URL.
- A doc an agent needs gets a row in the `/project-context` table, wherever it sits.
  Do not move a file to make it loadable.

## Reasons

- `docs` is the wrong type here because this repository's product **is** documents. A
  change to a skill is a feature or a fix, and typing it `docs` would make every commit
  the same.
- Attribution sits in `README.md` because a block inside a skill loads every time the
  skill fires, and the reader who needs it is a human browsing the repository.
- Method documentation sits outside the skill for the same reason, plus one more: the
  skills CLI installs the **folder**, so anything left inside is shipped into every
  repository that installs the skill, whether or not that repository wants it.
- `docs/` has no site generator because this repository has no `package.json` at all.
  A build, a config and a deploy for a handful of pages would cost more than they
  return while GitHub renders the markdown for free.
- Method docs stay in `docs/` rather than moving under a skill because the reader who
  most needs them has already installed the skill into their own repository and comes
  here to browse. `docs/` is the first place they look; `skills/internal/` announces
  itself as not for them.

## Fences

- **The block has exactly one home.** It lives in
  `skills/scaffolding/setup-jd-solanki-skills/SKILL.md` and is read from there. Copying
  it into this repository's `CLAUDE.md` would give one repository two copies of it, and
  the block's own single-source-of-truth rule forbids that. Read it where it lives.
- **A user-invoked skill cannot be reached by an agent.** `disable-model-invocation:
  true` strips the description from the agent's reach, so no other skill can fire it
  and no gate can name it. A skill something else must invoke has to stay
  model-invoked, whatever its context cost.

## Where it lives

`skills/scaffolding/setup-jd-solanki-skills/SKILL.md`,
`.claude/skills/writing-for-agents/`, `README.md`, `docs/`
